# Blackjack
How to beat the dealer thanks to Markov chains and Python?

Our work aimed at elaborating a mathematical model of Blackjack in order to figure out a strategy that maximizes the average amount you win on every bet. After developing such a model, we coded an algorithm that uses this model and gives the player the strategy he should follow to beat the dealer. To see if our algorithm was effective, we tested it on 10,000 hands and then we improved it a little.
In a nutshell, we created a computer programme that beats the dealer. Unfortunately you canâ€™t bring such a device in a casino.
